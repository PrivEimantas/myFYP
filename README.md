P2PFL is a general-purpose open-source library for the execution (simulated and in real environments) of Decentralized Federated Learning systems, specifically making use of P2P networks and the Gossip protocol.

## ‚ú® Key Features

P2PFL offers a range of features designed to make decentralized federated learning accessible and efficient. For detailed information, please refer to our [documentation](https://p2pfl.github.io/p2pfl/).

| Feature          | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| üöÄ Easy to Use   | Get started quickly with our intuitive API.       |
| üõ°Ô∏è Reliable     | Built for fault tolerance and resilience.       |
| üåê Scalable      | Leverages the power of peer-to-peer networks.    |
| üß™ Versatile     | Experiment in simulated or real-world environments.|
| üîí Private       | Prioritizes data privacy with decentralized architecture.|
| üß© Flexible      | Integrate with PyTorch and TensorFlow (coming soon!).|
| üìà Real-time Monitoring | Manage and track experiment through [P2PFL Web Services](https://p2pfl.com). | 
| üß† Model Agnostic | Use any machine learning model you prefer (e.g., PyTorch models). |
| üì° Communication Protocol Agnostic | Choose the communication protocol that best suits your needs (e.g., gRPC). |
## üì• Installation

> **Note:** We recommend using Python 3.9 or lower. We have found some compatibility issues with Python 3.10 and PyTorch.

### üë®üèº‚Äçüíª For Users

```bash
pip install "p2pfl[torch]"
```

### üë®üèº‚Äçüîß For Developers

#### üêç Python (using Poetry)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p2pfl/p2pfl.git
cd p2pfl
poetry install -E torch 
```

> **Note:** Use the extras (`-E`) flag to install specific dependencies (e.g., `-E torch`). Use `--no-dev` to exclude development dependencies.

#### üê≥ Docker

```bash
docker build -t p2pfl .
docker run -it --rm p2pfl bash
```
